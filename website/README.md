# 2 Factor Authentication
This is an example website for 2 Factor Auth using Fingerprint

## Important [Required]
Missing firebase config. Configure with your own firebase project. The instructions for setup are located in the [Firebase Docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup)

> The website doesn't provide a way to sign up. Add the functionality or use Firebase console to add users.

## TODO
The authentication state doesn't reset on logout. Need to manually reset using the Mobile Appilcation. Change it to reset on logout.

### About the implementation
The implementation/approach is not optimised for production and might require changes. You may use it at your own risk.
